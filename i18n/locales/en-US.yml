      When I was creating my website, I made a few strange decisions that are now easier to rewrite than try to fix.
      Although I've already made mockups of a new design for a long time, which looks a bit better, but I still can't get around to making it up.

      Even so, after a long time, I finally updated the information at 03.04.2025 and fixed some bugs, because I don't know how much longer I will defer the full recode.
